Prices paid can not be changed after transaction verification and all transactions entered onto public blockchain ledgers can not be returned or altered in anyway. If a transaction fails the verification process users will be notified and given the chance to fix any wrong information. Cryptoxygen does use a third party payment processor when dealing with all card based payments, the service provider or availability of this service is subject to change without notice.</p>
